Hello, world. To communicate with the world, I decided to build a blog to share some thoughts as a developer. To start, the first thing is to start with something simple. This blog is built with Next.js and blog-starter. Here, to start with a simple blog as a side project, after searching for all these tools, I landed up with Next.js and blog-starter, this will allow me to build a blog really quickly and in handy.

## This blog: Life has no ctrl Z.

Haven't thought of becoming a developer, but this is where life will take us, and I am responsible for all the decisions I have made. For the blog title: Life has no ctrl Z. As a developer, I can't help with using the commands very often, but in life, there is no ctrl Z, can't go back, can't redo all the decisions we have made.
