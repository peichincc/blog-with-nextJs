To look back in 2024 after 2025 started, still feel it's a good year with full empowerment. Integrated into the role at work, luckily, I got supportive colleagues and team members, it provides me opportunities to grow and take ownership in my role. As for life, also fortunate to build my social circle in my hobbies, bouldering, play Saxophone, and spend quality time with friends. Every year is a good year, and will be.

### Work

#### **Meetup: Held engineering meetup w/ADPList in Catawiki, attended AWS user group**

In May, we had _Breaking into Engineering: Journey as a Junior Developer_ in Catawiki HQ with ADPList Amsterdam Chamber, it attracted over 100 registrations and hosting 65+ attendees. Sharing my experiences as a woman in tech and an entry-level developer was empowering, both for the audience and myself.

Attended an AWS user group event, gaining insights into cloud technologies and expanding my network within the engineering community.

#### **Mentorship program from SheSharp**

Got this opportunity through community SheSharp, from March to July 2024, I met with my mentor
Mariam Adedeji every two weeks. She is always there to provide me with the insights and support necessary to navigate the complexities of my career path and professional growth. I am truly grateful for her mentorship.

#### **2 Internal tech talk to colleagues**

I delivered two talks (presentations) to our internal junior groups: _Component Integration test about Playwright_, and _Authentication (cookie, jwt)_. Public speaking, especially technical presentations, has always been a challenge for me. However, I wanted to share my "Aha!" moments—whether solving a bug, understanding a complex mechanism, or realizing that I finally get it (or don’t). These experiences not only deepened my knowledge but also helped me practice English public speaking. 😶‍🌫️

#### **300ish internal contribution, 2 open source contribution (Stripe issues)**

Yes, code. Also spotted some bugs in open repository to create tickets to other engineers 👩‍💻

#### **Two conferences: TNW (The Next Web), React Day Berlin**

I enjoy attending conferences—not just for the free coffee and snacks but also as a way to stay aligned with industry trends and innovations.

#### **Do one Advent of code**

2023 was 0, 2024 is 1. Progress is progress. 😆

### Life

#### **Play Saxophone twice in the public 🎷**

This year, I performed twice in public. I still wonder where I found the courage, but it certainly motivated me to practice more. Since moving, I found a relaxed saxophone teacher and continued my learning journey. This year I learned few songs: Careless Whisper, Take the 'A' train, Cantaloupe Island, BTS Butter. In the end, I found playing K-POP song is the best 💜

#### **Rock 🪨 trip to Fontainebleau (bouldering outdoor)**

Enjoy the forest, rocks, and good vibes.

#### **Travel to Taiwan, Germany, UK, Portugal, France**

That's the reason I could not save money in 2024, but still worth it.

#### **Donate blood 2 times 🩸**

Since moving to the Netherlands, donating in Taiwan has become more challenging (due to the required one-month wait after travel). So, I found _[Sanquin](https://www.sanquin.nl/)_ in the Netherlands and started donating there. If I am healthy, well-fed, and full of energy, I feel it’s important to give back where needed.

#### **Visit museums**

Thanks to Museum card for the most of weekends.

#### **Spend time with friends and family**

Nice to meet new friends and have friends in town. Also, flying back to home country is also needed. Happy to see everyone's face in person and be with people. That's what life is all about.

Thanks 2024.
